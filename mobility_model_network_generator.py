class Model:
    '''
    Main model class for the simulation. 

    The following describes the initialization phase. 

    1. The model landscape is initialized and all the CBGs are read in.
        
        - When a CBG object is created, it initializes a population of agents equivalent to the number of households recorded in census data.
    
    2. A subset of agents are selected to be initially infected.
        
        - A CBG can be selected as a seed for the initial infection or can be randomly distributed across the simulation.
        
        - The logic for this will likely need to be redone as currently only a proportion of a population is used. This means that if a random 
          selection of agents are selected, the number of infected agents will be higher. For example, if 5% of agents are selected for a CBG 
          of 1000 agents, there will be 100 agents infected. If 5% are chosen with a random selection the model may have 500,000 agents that 
          would mean that there are 5000 agents infected. 
    
    3. POIs are read in and created. 
 
    4. NAICS codes are read in and created.
